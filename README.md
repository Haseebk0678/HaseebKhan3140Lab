# HaseebKhan3140Lab

## Lab 1

While in the folder HaseebKhan3140Lab (the main folder) run the command below to for lab1
```bash
make lab1
```
### Report
In this lab I reported out the ranking of each car given to us through a csv file, after that I created a text file which sorts the cars in reverse order by ranking. I then found the top three of the highest ranked cars and wrote them into a file. The raw data contained a numerical value for each part that may be important in a car and then by adding them up we get the ranking.




### Output

The first part of lab 1 is the file sorted.out in the folder lab_1

The second part of lab 1 is the file topThreeSorted.out if you want to see it sorted by car name and topThree.out if sorted by ranking


## Lab 2

To start lab 2 run
```bash
make lab2
```
### Dependencies
