Hi, my name is Haseeb Khan, I'm currently a junior at (I don't think I need to include this but might as well) Brooklyn College in the Macaulay Honors Program, I'm currently majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Data Science. My career interests would probably have to be in Software Engineering. I've so far done two internship one wokring at a startup using HTML, CSS, and JS, and another using mainly python to create a rule's engine. I would say my career goal/long term plan is probably to work for a few years and then go back to college for further education. I initally planned on majoring in math, but then did computer science because it seemed easier to get a career after. For hobbies, I like walking and exercising, reading, and picked up cooking during the pandemic.
